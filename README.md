A browser extension aiming to bypass the Netflix household verification prompts by employing different strategies depending on the page context.

**Supports:** `Chrome` (and Chromium-based browsers like Edge) | `Firefox`

---

## Features

- **Extensive GraphQL Request Blocking:**
  - On `/watch` pages, the extension **aggressively blocks all GraphQL network requests** related to Netflix's household verification.
  - This is done at the network level, so you can verify in the browser's Network tab that these requests are stopped before reaching Netflix servers.
  - This is the core feature and is maintained to adapt to Netflix's frequent backend changes.

- **Hides Verification Modal on `/browse` (and others):**
  - On pages *other* than `/watch/` (like the main browse page), it hides the household verification modal popup if it appears.

- **Target Scope:**
  - Only affects `netflix.com` domains.

## Caveats & Known Issues

- **Netflix Video Player UI is not visible:**  
  If you don't see the video player UI, just refresh the page. That should fix it.

- **Netflix Updates:**  
  Netflix frequently updates its website and internal APIs. Any changes to:
  - The GraphQL endpoint URL,
  - The request structure,
  - The page structure (`/watch/` path), or
  - The modal's CSS selectors/HTML structure  
  could break this extension partially or completely.  
  **We monitor and update the GraphQL blocking logic as needed.**

- **Console Errors:**  
  On `/watch/` pages, you **will** see network errors (often CORS-related) in the browser's developer console. This is expected and shows the extension is successfully blocking GraphQL requests.

- **Fragile CSS:**  
  The modal hiding relies on specific CSS class names and `data-uia` attributes. These might change without notice.
